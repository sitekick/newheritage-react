			<p>The primary mission of New Heritage has two overarching elements. First, the company will continue with and significantly expand its work with true historical structures. This will include protecting and preserving certain properties, while it will involve repurposing and giving new life to other projects.</p>
<p>We have found there are a number of valuable properties that mean a great deal to their communities and represent a significant portion of what you might call local DNA. However, many of these fine old buildings, and a large number of homes, have outlived their usefulness and are, in fact, in serious violation of their local codes.</p>
<p>In the first instance, we work to update and restore structures to their original condition, using as many of the original elements as possible. In fact, we have probably the best team of scavengers in existence, and they are responsible for looking at flea markets, salvage yards, and every place imaginable to find just the perfect door knob, window, or fixture to complete a realistic restoration.</p>
<p>For our repurposing projects, we will work with the clients and local officials to protect and preserve the spirit and essence of a structure while totally updating it. We have found we can add value to these structures while keeping the uniqueness they possess. In fact, many of these projects are totally pre-leased before we start construction due to their high emotional draw for both locals and national tenants alike.</p>
<p>We are also very excited about our second mission, that of bringing a historic appeal to totally new communities, structures and homes. Depending on your generation, historic means a lot of different things. We have successfully recreated the look and feel of turn of the 20th century downtowns, and we have also been involved in more modern projects, such as restoring a collection of art deco hotels in Miami.</p>
<p>We are currently in various stages of four different projects that include a downtown for a major new development, two new residential projects, and the total rebuilding of a four-block area of a major metropolitan downtown site.</p>
